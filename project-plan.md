## Notes
- Each task is estimated at 1 story point
- Story points represent relative complexity, not time
- Tasks within epics can be worked on in parallel where dependencies allow
- Each epic should be completed with testing and documentation
- Regular review points should be scheduled after each epic
- Consider user feedback after each major feature implementation

## Technical Stack
- Electron for desktop application
- Vite for build tooling
- React + TypeScript for UI
- Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI for styling
- FFmpeg for video processing
- SQLite for local storage
- Jest for testing
- Electron Builder for distribution

## Development Workflow
1. Start with Epic 1 to establish foundation
2. Core video processing (Epic 2) should be prioritized early
3. UI components can be developed in parallel with backend services
4. Regular integration points between frontend and backend
5. Performance optimization should be ongoing
6. Testing should be implemented alongside feature development
